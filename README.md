# 🎙️ Stark — Voice Assistant (Desktop + Web App)

**Stark** is a lightweight voice-controlled assistant built using **Python (Flask)** and **React.js**.  
It allows users to interact through voice or text to perform basic tasks like opening popular websites and telling the current time — all through a clean, chat-style interface.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 🧩 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StarkVoiceAssistant.git
cd StarkVoiceAssistant


🔗 How It Works

The React frontend handles the user interface, voice input, and text-to-speech.

The Flask backend processes the commands and sends responses back as JSON.

Commands like “open YouTube” or “what’s the time” trigger predefined actions.
